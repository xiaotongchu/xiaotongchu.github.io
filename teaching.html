      <p>I guided students through weekly writing assignments and tutorial discussions, focusing on writing research papers, developing scientific writing skills, critical thinking, and creating convincing arguments. Students worked on predetermined topics, adjusted their research questions, and engaged in literature review and hypothesis development. Additionally, they wrote method sections, analyzed simulated datasets, reported results, and critically reflected on their findings. </p>

      <p>I served as the second examiner for grading Bachelor theses in the Psychology department at the University of Amsterdam.

      <p>In this course, students collaborated with sustainability marketing practitioners from NGOs and government organizations.
